SYNC VS ASYNC

SYNC:
  SERIAL EXECUTION
  IT WAITS FOR SINGLE OPERATION TO COMPLETE, BEFORE PERFORMING NEXT OPERATION

  IF YOUR OPERATIONS ARE NOT DOING HEAVY LIFTING WORK LIKE QUERYING HUGE DATA FROM DATABASE
  (SIMPLE AND SMALL OPERATIONS)
//  CAN BE USED IF YOUR OPERATIONS NEEDS THE PREVIOUS RESULT TO PERFORM THE NEXT ONE

ASYNC:
  PARALLEL EXECUTION

NEVER WAITS FOR EACH OPERATION TO COMPLETE, IT EXECUTES ALL OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST GO ONLY.
THE RESULT OF EACH OPERATION WILL BE HANDLED ONCE THE RESULT IS AVAILABLE.

NODE IS SINGLE THREADED BUT YOU CAN PERFORM ASYNC OPERATIONS IN BACKGROUND LIKE:
  ONE THREAD IS DOING FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS WHILE THE MAIN NODE THREAD KEEPS EXECUTING YOUR JAVASCRIPT CODE

IF YOU WANT TO RENDER SOMETHING WHILE IN BACKGROUND PERFORMING HEAVY WEIGHT OPERATIONS 
GOOD FOR GUI APPS
